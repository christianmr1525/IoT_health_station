# IoT Health Monitoring Station

This project consisted on creating an health monitoring embedded system using a ESP32 microcontroller.

This project is a full-stack IoT-based health monitoring station, built entirely from scratch using an ESP32 microcontroller. It integrates multiple biomedical and environmental sensors to collect and transmit real-time data to a web dashboard, enabling remote health and environmental monitoring.
